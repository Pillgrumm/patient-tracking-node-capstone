This application is meant to be used for the medical staff of a neonatal intensive care unit. The staff will be able to keep record
of patient information simply by logging into their units (or personal) account to get a list of existing patient records, while
also being able to update existing records and add brand new ones.

I am not in the medical field myself but my father is; he pitched this as an idea and it was decided that this would be a very good project to practice building a full stack application.
